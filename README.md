# Python_Maze
Given a 2D grid of cells with obstacles and passages.

1.  Write an algorithm which finds the shortest path from a cell A in the grid to a cell B in the grid, while only moving up, down, left or right through cells with passages. 

2.  Log the route description to the console when done or an error message if no way was found. The grid should be represented as 2D list of booleans.
    Think about test cases and write unit tests to verify your good works properly



## Breadth First Search Algorithm
The breadth first search algorithm is a very famous algorithm that is used to traverse a tree or graph data structure. It is guaranteed to find the shortest path from a start node to an end node if such path exists. This algorithm can be used for a variety of different tasks but for this example we will use it to solve a maze.
